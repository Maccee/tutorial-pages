// SearchUtils.js

// Function to perform search
// Depending on your application architecture, you might want to pass additional parameters
// or return values from this function, such as fetching data from an API
export const performSearch = async ({keyword, setKeyword}) => {
  // Set the keyword state. This could trigger other useEffect hooks elsewhere in your app
  // that react to changes in the keyword state.
  setKeyword(keyword);

  // If your search involves fetching data from an API, you would typically do it here.
  // For example:
  // const data = await fetchDataBasedOnKeyword(keyword);
  // return data; // Then handle this data in the component that called performSearch.
};

// Include any other search-related utility functions here as needed.
